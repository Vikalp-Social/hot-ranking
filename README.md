## How to Run
Follow the steps below to run the server after cloning/pulling into your local device. (React - v18.2.0)  
You will also need to be running our frontend simultaneously ([mystodon](https://github.com/Vikalp-Social/mystodon)).  
Default port of the server is set to `3000`.

1) `npm i`
2) `nodemon api.js`
